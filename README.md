#Attempting Consistency while learning something new


I always dodge using git, as well as practicing Data structures and Algorithms
This is my attempt to learn using both of them
**and** 
Trying to get myself to code more often to become more consistent

> I will try to add some of the explenations to the problems w/ code


As far as I can tell the references I will be using for this code are[^1]: 
- *Elements of Programming Interviews in Python*
- MIT intro to Algorithms Fall 2011
- csgeek.org has post going over explaining problems[^2]









[^1] got both references from Tren Black, Nick White and KC on YT
[^2] Joseph V. Boss has informational videos called pen&paper programming going through the book
     I like to read over the book and go through a video to reinforce the concept.
