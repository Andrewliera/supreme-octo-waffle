#Attempting Consistency while learning something new


I always dodge using git, as well as practicing Data structures and Algorithms
This is my attempt to learn using both of them
**and** 
Trying to get myself to code more often to become more consistent


As far as I can tell the references I will be using for this code are[^1]: 
- *Elements of Programming Interviews in Python*
- MIT intro to Algorithms Fall 2011









[^1] got both references from Tren Black on YT
