#write a program which tests if two rectangles have a non empty intersection
# book hint: think of the X and Y dimensions independently 
# according to the book, the problem is unspecified enough 
# so that we can also take into account the border of the rectangle
# in otherwords, two rectangles with touching corners is enough to count as "intersecting"
# good book approach:
# focus on conditions where the rectangles are guaranteed NOT intersecting 
# another way to think about it
